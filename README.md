# Dachshund On Demand
A chrome extension that displays a random dachshund photo whenever clicked. For Sam.

## Goal
Sam loves dachshunds. I like to send her dachshund photos. It's getting harder to find new photos because I just look through Google Images. I want a way for her to find a really random picture of her favorite breed when she's frustrated with homework, or has puppy fever.

I also want to learn how to create a Chrome extension, because Antriksh Yadav suggested it as a good first personal project at his blog [here](http://antrikshy.com/blog/how-i-got-started-with-programming-side-projects).
