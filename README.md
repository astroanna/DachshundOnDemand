Dog On Demand

A chrome extension that displays a random dog photo whenever clicked. For Sam.

Goal
------
Sam loves dachshunds. I like to send her dachshund photos. It's getting harder to find new photos because I just look through Google Images. I wanted a way for her to find a really random picture of her favorite breed when she's frustrated with homework, or has puppy fever.

I also wanted to learn how to create a Chrome extension, because Antriksh Yadav suggested it as a good first personal project at his blog [here](http://antrikshy.com/blog/how-i-got-started-with-programming-side-projects).

The Extension
------
When the app icon is clicked, Dog On Demand displays a popup with a random picture of a dog of a specified breed, which is specified in the Extension's options (found by right-clicking the extension icon).

Credits
------
All dog images are retrieved using the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/).
All images are resized using the jquery script from [image-scale by gestixi](https://github.com/gestixi/image-scale).
